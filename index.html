        <h2>Why Auto Insurance Matters</h2>
        <p>Auto insurance is more than just a legal requirement—it’s a financial safety net. It protects you against costly repairs, medical bills, and liability claims in case of an accident.</p>

            <li><strong>Liability Coverage:</strong> Covers damages to another person’s property or injuries caused by your vehicle.</li>
            <li><strong>Comprehensive Insurance:</strong> Protects your car from theft, vandalism, and natural disasters.</li>
            <li><strong>Collision Coverage:</strong> Pays for damage to your vehicle after an accident.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical Payments Coverage:</strong> Helps cover medical expenses for you and your passengers.</li>
        </ul>
